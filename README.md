# Wave-Physics-Fractal-Simulation

This project visualizes a **dynamic fractal particle system** using wave physics simulations powered by **Three.js**. It generates thousands of particles that move based on customizable wave functions, allowing real-time exploration of wave frequency, amplitude, speed, damping, and wave types (sine/cosine).

## Features

- **Wave-based particle physics** with sine and cosine wave options
- Interactive GUI using **dat.GUI** for customizing simulation parameters
- Real-time **particle size** adjustment
- Intuitive **OrbitControls** for easy navigation

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ClickClickDerk/Wave-Physics-Fractal-Simulation.git

    Open index.html in your favorite browser to run the simulation.

Parameters (dat.GUI)

    Frequency: Adjust the wave's frequency.
    Amplitude: Control the height of the wave.
    Speed: Set the speed of the wave propagation.
    Damping: Modify the damping factor for wave attenuation.
    Wave Type: Toggle between sine and cosine waveforms.
    Particle Size: Change the size of the rendered particles in real-time.
